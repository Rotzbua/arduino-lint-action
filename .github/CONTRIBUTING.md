## Development

To work on the codebase you have to install all the dependencies:

```sh
# npm install
```

To run tests set the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` with a valid Personal Access Token and then:

```sh
# npm run test
```

See the [official Github documentation][pat-docs] to learn more about Personal Access Tokens.

## Release

1. `npm install` to add all the dependencies, included development.
2. `npm run build` to build the Action under the `./lib` folder.
3. `npm run test` to see everything works as expected.
4. `npm run pack` to package for distribution
5. `git add src dist` to check in the code that matters.
6. open a PR and request a review.
